# Pi_Color_Image_Creator

This project looks at each digit of pi and assigns it a color based off of this general mapping:

0 = white, 1 = teal, 2 = blue,  3= pink, 4= green,
5= orange, 6= red,   7= yellow, 8= grey, 9= black

I assign each color to a pixel inside of an image and then save that picture to the directory the script is in.
